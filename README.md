# virtual-hoover
A program that navigates a imaginary robotic hoover through an equally imaginary room.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. Because we are using new ES6 features, make sure your Node is up to date (e.g. v4.4.3).

## Setup

Open your terminal at the root of this project and run "npm install" to install all of the dependencies.

## Run

To run the program, open your terminal at the root of this project and run "node index.js".

## Tests

To run the test suite, install Mocha globally on your machine with the following command: "npm install -g mocha".

Open your terminal at the root of this project and run "npm test" to run all tests. Use 'mocha ./test/{file-name}' at the root of this project to run individual files.

## Grunt

A default Grunt task has been defined to lint and beautify JS files in the project.

To run Grunt, install Grunt globally on your machine with the following command: "npm install -g grunt".

Open your terminal at the root of this project and run "grunt" to kick off the default task. To have Grunt kick off the default task each time a JS file changes, run "grunt watch" in your terminal.
